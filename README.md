# UESessionLogger
Session Logger is a lightweight, zero-dependency logging plugin for Unreal that lets you emit structured JSON Lines (JSONL) directly from Blueprints. Log any struct, array, map, or primitive (int, float, bool, string, name, text, byte, int64) with one node per case, plus a raw “Log Event (JSON)” sink when you already have JSON.
